LibreSignage User Settings
##########################

The *Settings* page is accessible by all LibreSignage users. On this page
the users can view their username and groups and change their password
as well as view all active sessions.

Passwords can be changed by writing the new password into the *Password*
and *Confirm password* input fields and clicking save. If the two fields
match, the password is changed. The maximum length of passwords is defined
in the LibreSignage instance config and can be changed by the server admin.
The default limit is 256 characters.

At the bottom of the page is a list of active sessions with some
information about them. Note that the names displayed in the list are
not always accurate and shouldn't be trusted for identification since
the program connecting to the LibreSignage API can freely choose the
name that's displayed. The button *Logout other sessions* can be used
to terminate all other sessions except the current one.
