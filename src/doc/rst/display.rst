LibreSignage display
####################

The LibreSignage display is the page where all the LibreSignage slides
can be viewed. This page is meant to be displayed on the client machines.

If the display page is opened using the link in the main navigation bar,
a selection dialog is shown so that the user can select a slide queue
to show. If you select a queue and then look at the address bar of the
web browser, you can see that the url now has ``?q=<QUEUE>`` appended
to it. ``<QUEUE>`` is the name of the queue you selected. When you want
to launch the LibreSignage display page on a standalone client, you can
bypass the queue selection dialog by simply navigating to the correct
URL corresponding to the queue you want to show.
